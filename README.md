 Hello ! How are you guys? 
 
 I'm a graduating in information systems, I have a little  knowledge in Frond End like react.js, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, , and on the Back End I know little bit of PHP and MySQL.       Currently I'm studying about Flutter and I'm very exicated with it. In my spare time I like to play some games, play my guitar, watch and read some animes and mangas :D
